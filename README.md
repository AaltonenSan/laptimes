# Laptimes
Website for users to post their own laptimes, view laptimes from other users and keep ranking lists for Finnish racetracks.

Project was made for back-end programming course using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL and Thymeleaf.

#### Future ideas:
- [ ] Add top-3 list to each track in Rataranking page
- [ ] Add profile picture to users
- [ ] Users can edit their profile
- [ ] Bug or suspicious laptime reporting
- [ ] Email authentication
- [ ] Ability to see other user profiles
